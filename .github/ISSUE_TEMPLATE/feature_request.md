  ## A note on adding features to Zionbuilder and its official plugins

  Every feature needs to strike a balance - complex features are less likely to be worked on, whether that complexity comes from design, implementation or ongoing   maintenance costs. On the other side, features that are useful to all (or most) of Zionbuilder's users are more likely to be accepted.

  This means that not every feature request will be added to Zionbuilder, but hearing about what you want Zionbuilder to do is important. Don't be afraid to add a feature request!

### Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
