## Description
Below are listed the core competencies

### Elements and templates at your fingertip
Add elements and templates right where you need them from the page builder "Add Elements Popup"

### Basic 27 elements
* Section
* Column
* Text Editor
* Custom HTML
* Shortcode
* Google Maps
* Counter
* Progress Bars

### Independent composition of elements
Each element is composed from a wrapper and its sub-components. For example a button is composed from a wrapper, the button and the icon, and each one of them may have individual styles applied.

### Unified system of options
Every element has the same easy to use and intuitive options pattern found in the “Element Options” panel. It consists of 3 main tabs: general, styling, advanced and search.

### Global styles
In order to apply the same styles on multiple elements, Global CSS Classes were implemented. They can be styled either from page options panel, or from the Element options panel. No coding skills required.

### Live responsive editing
Visually decide the sizes, colors or positioning of the elements for each screen. This means that any changes made to the mobile view, will only appear on that device and it will not affect the other devices, which will still maintain the original design options.

### Custom rich text on click
Inline editor is triggered on text click, and provides options such as font family, size, weight, spacing, alignment or text-transform. It can also be dragged anywhere.

### Gradient background
You can layer multiple gradients by making use of color opacity. When set a lower opacity of gradient colors, other gradient layers become visible. Experiment with a different options on different gradient layers.

### Manage loaded resources
You can choose what fonts , colors, gradients, icon packs or templates to appear in the page builder. That means you can choose only the fonts you need in your website even if on the dashboard you have access to hundreds of other fonts.

### History of actions
Saving system, history of your actions, post revisions, users permissions or easily discard changes give you the power of becoming the sole creator of your website. Shortcuts for undo and redo are also available.

### Design features
The following extra design features come built in the Panel Element Options: Blending Bakground, ColorPicker, Pseudo – selectors, Element’s motion control, Flexbox control, Powerful background image, Filters, Borders, Shadows, Typography, Transform, Transitions
